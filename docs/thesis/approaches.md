# Approaches to reducing boilerplate code

As we suggested in the introduction, people came up with plenty of approaches for reducing boilerplate code.
In this chapter, we will explore some of them.
It is important to keep the alternatives in mind to choose the right one for a given situation.
Moreover, we will see many good idea that we reuse in our work.

## Linq.Expressions + Reflection.Emit

## Scala macros

## F# type providers

## Dynamic (JSON deserialization)

Note that C# has a `dynamic` keyword, which allows programmers to do exactly this kind of things.
In our experience, it not used very widely, since C# programmers do not want to lose their type safety.

## IL weaving

## C# source generators

## Roslyn tree
